## Knit

#### Fair isle
A style of knitting with multiple strands of different colors to create a pattern

#### Float
When carrying the yarn behind the work in colorwork knitting e.g. [fair isle](#fair-isle), the unworked yarn will create 

#### Garter
For a piece worked flat: continuous knit rows, such that the fabric has some ridges when viewed from the [RS](#right-side-rs). For a piece worked in the round: alternating rows of knit and purl, such that the fabric looks uniform on the [RS](#right-side-rs). Note: The garter stitch will not generally curl, unlike stockinette. The garter stitch also looks the same when viewed from the [RS](#right-side-rs) vs. [WS](#wrong-side-ws).

#### Knit stitch
The most basic type of stitch

#### Purl stitch 
The inverse of a knit stitch such that if you knit a knit stitch row flat, flip the work, and then knit a purl stitch row, when looking from the [RS](#right-side-rs), the two completed rows will look the same.

#### Right side (RS)
The front of the work

#### Steek
A technique in which the completed work is prepared and cut (with scissors!). This is commonly used to knit a piece in the round (for convenience, tension, etc.) but which needs an opening, e.g. cardigan. 

#### Stockinette 
For a piece worked flat: alternating rows of knit and purl, such that the fabric looks uniform on the [RS](#right-side-rs). For a piece worked in the round: continuous knit rows, such that the fabric looks uniform on the [RS](#right-side-rs). Note: Due to the construction of the knit stitch, stockinette will usually end up curling at the edges.
