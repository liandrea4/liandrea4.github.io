## Notes 
This was my first almost commission! Let me explain.

Soumya was one of my bridesmaids so for my wedding, as a thank you gift, I had made and given her a pillow with an S on it (among a couple other things). Well apparently she loved it so much that she asked if she could pay me to make her another pillow but this time for her roommate, Mel! I was so flattered! My first commission! I was originally thinking about asking for her to pay for materials only, but then materials were like $15 so it just seemed unnecessary. So I told her I would just make it for her for free because it is so heartwarming and flattering that she liked her pillow so much! So I ended up just doing it for free but still! My first almost commission! 

Same 12"x12" pillow insert as I used for Soumya's, same yarn, same pattern, and just a new chart.
