## Details
- Yarn: (Very mismatched) assorted worsted weight
- Hook size: don't remember :( 
- [Pattern](https://yarnandchai.com/malia-christmas-stocking/)
- Made for: me and Joe

## Notes 
I was using up cheap acrylic yarn (did you really expect anything else?) but I ran out halfway through (again, did you really expect anything else?). I prefer the colors of Joe's stocking much more - they feel much bright and  crisper. But I ran out halfway through his stocking, so on the reverse side, there is a very noticeable color change in white and change in red. The fiber was also different - the bright red felt much stiffer than the duller red. So Joe's stocking is a hybrid, but like I said, I thought it looked better. But that's why mine is so different-looking than his. 

The best way I could figure out to add the names was surface slip stitching on the white cuff. I think it looks pretty bad - I should probably have used something less contrast-y than pure black, but I also just don't look the way the letters look. Oh well, that is why I made knit ones too! 

Fun fact: I partially knit these stocking driving back to California from Colorado after picking up the Mustang from Joe's brother. What a long (20 hours!) drive!
