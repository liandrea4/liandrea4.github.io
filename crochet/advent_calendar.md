- [Pattern](https://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/ideas/decor-hobbies/how-to-crochet-a-mini-stocking-advent)
- Made for: me and Joe :)

## Notes 
Not many modifications to this pattern (although I will say that at first I did try going up and going down in # of stitches for the advent calendar and it was either way too big or way too small - follow the pattern). The only thing is, I plan to attach buttons along the long single crochet chain so that the mini stockings are removeable. Joe and I were thinking that when we have kids, it can be an advent tradition to hide the mini stocking somewhere in the house with some chocolate inside, the kids need to find the stocking, and then they hang it up on an open button. I still need to figure out how to attach the buttons to the sc chain - will update when I've done it.

This project was really quick at first! The mini stockings are really fast to make and it was super satisfying to finish them so quickly. The problem is that in the middle of this project, we went to Hawaii because of COVID and I didn't bring it back with me. And then when we came back to California to pack up, I finished the rest of the mini stockings super fast! But I needed buttons for the sc chain and I didn't want to buy them right before the move so I waited til after the move. Well after the move, we never even unpacked because our life is so up in the air! So the mini stockings are still packed away. I bought buttons though! But I need to figure out how to attach them, and anyways it wasn't urgent to finish by Christmas 2020 anyways because we are just hopping between houses. So I will probably just unpack the mini stockings whenever we settle down (***if*** we ever settle down) and then finish up the sc chain then.
