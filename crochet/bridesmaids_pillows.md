## Notes 
I carried the black for the duration of the letter and the dropped it after the letter was done. I carried it back to the start of the row (sometimes having 2 bobbins of working yarn for very wide section) and knit over it so hide the float on the inside. I used a standard polyester pillow insert for the inside. 12"x12" for the S pillows and 12"x16" for the L pillow (maid of honor). I could've added a zipper for ease of cleaning but I was too lazy :)
