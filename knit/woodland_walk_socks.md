## Notes
This was the first pair of socks I have knit! The pattern was lovely to knit - interesting enough to not become too monotonous but also simple enough to eventually memorize. It also looks very nice. 

The tension is a little wonky - the socks definitely could've been a little bit tighter but all in all, pretty good for my first pair of socks if I do say so myself!
