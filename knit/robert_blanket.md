## Notes
Antonietta and Charles had their first baby! I wanted to use the yarn that Antonietta had gifted to me (it was leftover yarn from when Antonietta had made a blanket for Summer when Jen was first pregnant). I was originally going to do a cute sailboat pattern but because of the really fuzzy yarn, you couldn't really see it at all. So I frogged it and just went with something simple. I added a garter border (I think 4 st on each side but I don't quite remember) so the blanket wouldn't curl and then just followed the pattern (going for sand and ocean waves). I forgot to take a picture before I packaged it up though :( But I hope it keeps Robert warm!
