## Notes

It's been getting pretty cold around here and I don't have any gloves! I have a pair that I crocheted awhile back with Heartland yarn but 1) they're super bulky, and 2) they have huge holes in them because they are crocheted, and 3) they are acrylic and so technically not supposed to be super warm. So I've been meaning to knit a pair of gloves but I've been super intimidated so been putting it off but my hands are cold! So here goes! 


## Timeline 

- 12/8/2021: I decided to do a tubular cast on which is supposed to be good for nice solid edges for ribbing, following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbElPT1bCg8). I was a bit torn between the tubular cast on and the [alternating cable cast on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDtcabyPQaI) but from what I can tell, the tubular cast on is supposed to be all around better (cleaner, stretchier, etc.) but just more effort. So I figured I might as well put in the effort and do the tubular cast on. I started casting on but the pattern is written for DK weight yarn and I am using sock yarn so I decided to knit a gauge swatch :( Just a little one because I hate gauge swatches but at least to know how many stitches per inch (and caring less about rows per inch). I did it with scrap yarn in another colorway and with long needles as I figured it would be easier so there may be slight discrepancy but hopefully not significant. 
    - Pattern calls for: 6.75 stitches per inch
    - My mini gauge swatch: 7 stitches per inch
  So I essentially got gauge and I have little wrists anyways so I think I will do the small size. Well I guess the frogging was for nothing! I was going to make the small size regardless!
