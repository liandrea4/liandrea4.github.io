# Christmas tree skirt

[*Back to home page*](..)

(Jan 2021 - ongoing) Fair isle Christmas tree skirt. 

#### Details
- Yarn: Red heart super saver, 100% acrylic
- Needle size: 10.5 (6.5mm) 

#### Notes

After having made so many pairs of socks recently, I've been itching to do a project with heavier yarn weight to give my eyes and hands a break. I've done a handful of fair isle projects in the past - see [Christmas stockings](https://liandrea4.github.io/knit/christmas-stockings.html)! - but I wanted to try again now that I knit continental to see if it is easier. 

I saw the [perfect pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jolaskjol) on Reddit but it cost $6.50 and I am a cheapo. I still haven't ventured into purchasing patterns yet. So I decided to find a [free pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/christmas-tree-skirt) instead and adapt it to incorporate some colorwork. 

##### Modifications
- Knit in the round and steek: The paid pattern that I liked used wool yarn, was knit in the round, and then steeked (aka cut!) for the tree skirt opening. The free pattern was knit flat in 7 separate panels and then seamed together. Given that I wanted to do colorwork and was worried about tension on the purl side, I decided to knit my tree skirt in the round and steek it. 
    - Steek complications: Steeking is usually only recommended for wool fiber so that the edge once cut will felt together. But part of the whole goal of this project is to use up some cheap acrylic yarn. So I wanted to try to steek my cheap 100% acrylic yarn. I did a couple test swatches, and have decided to combine the [crochet method](https://blog.tincanknits.com/2014/09/18/steek/) and the [knit facing](https://www.purlsoho.com/create/steek-with-knit-facing/) method with some (more) modifications.
