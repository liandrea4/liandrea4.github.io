(Jan 2021 - ongoing) Fair isle Christmas tree skirt. 

## Details
- Yarn: Red heart super saver, 100% acrylic
- Needle size: 10.5 (6.5mm) 

## Notes

After having made so many pairs of socks recently, I've been itching to do a project with heavier yarn weight to give my eyes and hands a break. I've done a handful of fair isle projects in the past - see [Christmas stockings](https://liandrea4.github.io/knit/christmas-stockings.html)! - but I wanted to try again now that I knit continental to see if it is easier. 

I saw the [perfect pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jolaskjol) on Reddit but it cost $6.50 and I am a cheapo. I still haven't ventured into purchasing patterns yet. So I decided to find a [free pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/christmas-tree-skirt) instead and adapt it to incorporate some colorwork. 

### Knit in the round and steek
The paid pattern that I liked used wool yarn, was knit in the round, and then steeked (aka cut!) for the tree skirt opening. The free pattern was knit flat in 7 separate panels and then seamed together. Given that I wanted to do colorwork and was worried about tension on the purl side, I decided to knit my tree skirt in the round and steek it. 

#### Steek complications
Steeking is usually only recommended for wool fiber so that the edge once cut will felt together. But part of the whole goal of this project is to use up some cheap acrylic yarn. So I wanted to try to steek my cheap 100% acrylic yarn. I did a couple test swatches, and have decided to combine the [crochet method](https://blog.tincanknits.com/2014/09/18/steek/) and the [knit facing](https://www.purlsoho.com/create/steek-with-knit-facing/) method with some (more) modifications.

The facing knit out of the first row of purl bumps connects to stitch 2 (red) and the facing knit out of the last row of purl bumps connects to stitch 8 (red). This hides the white edge while keeping short floats across the steek (as recommended). The crochet steek is done along stitch 5: right leg of stitch 4 and left leg of stitch 5; and right leg of stitch 5 and left leg of stitch 6. 

In my test swatches, the steek using the two of these methods in combination was successful! Even with 100% acrylic yarn!  

#### Cable
Due to the way that I modified the pattern to be knit in the round instead of in flat panels, I need a really long cable (long enough to fit the circumference of the completed tree skirt). By my calculations, that means for a tree skirt of 50" diameter (which is about how large I expect mine to be), I'll need a 150" cable! I only have a 40" cable! 

So I bought a 60" cable, and I also found out that my interchangeable needle set came with one cable connector. This means that I can combine my new 60" cable with my 40" cable and at least reach 100". Hoping that the 60" cable I bought comes with another cable connector, and then I should be able to squeeze all the stitches onto the cable. Fingers crossed!


### Colorwork

In the free pattern that I was adapting, the panels were worked in one color with cables added to make it a little more interesting. It looks like a nice pattern, but I wanted to do some colorwork! So I drew up some [colorwork charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_Y1Wf927mVhW20_oe02OGYtjdgfHwHbw5BVyQX9De0/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-6fYauzAFE5SAXcqDEL8IqQ). The hardest part was the fact that this was worked in discrete panels and that the bottom of the chart (further away from the tree) was wider than the top of the chart (closer to the tree). So any pattern that I did had to flow evenly across both the top (narrower) and bottom (fatter) part of each pannel. 

In the end, I decided to have a pattern for each panel, so unfortunately each panel will be able to be clearly distinguished from the others, but I couldn't figure out another way to do it. In the paid pattern, it somehow looks super nice and uniform and like one single piece instead of multiple panels. I have no idea how they did it. Perhaps at the end of all of this work, I will end up paying for the pattern just to satisfy my curiosity. 

I did a bunch of different variations - snowflake with versus without cables, larger versus smaller snowflakes, other patterns like Christmas trees, etc. I'll keep all those charts just in case for the future! 

### Size 

I am super worried about running out of yarn! It's not too big of a deal because I can just buy more, but 1) I am worried about dye lots :( this yarn is super old, and 2) the whole point of this project was to get rid of yarn not buy more! So I decided to make the tree skirt a little smaller than described in the free pattern (a total of 136 instead of 148 rows) but it will likely be roughly the same size.
