## Notes

Stretchy cast on 37 st, work in pattern, and stretchy bind off. 

For a neater edge, I did a selvedge. I've heard of this before but had never been able to make it work! Essentially for the first stitch of every row, hold the yarn in front, slip as if to purl, and then move the yarn to the back as usual for the rest of the row. Holding the stitch in front while slipping is the key! I've tried this so many times before, and that was what finally made for a neat edge. It is a bit sparse of an edge so it doesn't provide too much structure but it is very neat :) 

I worked the pieces so they are a bit taller so that there is excess to fold over for a bungee cord to go through for hanging.
