## Notes

I made one fancy hockey target with US 11 (8mm) and [this pattern](http://maggiesrags.com/dishcloth.pdf). But it was massive and really floppy so I decided to frog it and not do anything fancy. So after that I went down a couple needle sizes and just did a garter rectangle: Stretchy cast on xx st (I think I varied this, but it was something around 32-38 st), work in garter, and stretchy bind off. 

For a neater edge, I did a selvedge. I've heard of this before but had never been able to make it work! Essentially for the first stitch of every row, hold the yarn in front, slip as if to purl, and then move the yarn to the back as usual for the rest of the row. Holding the stitch in front while slipping is the key! I've tried this so many times before, and that was what finally made for a neat edge. It is a bit sparse of an edge so it doesn't provide too much structure but it is very neat :) 

I worked the pieces so they are a bit taller so that there is excess to fold over for a cord to go through for hanging. We didn't have any long enough bungee cords and I didn't want to buy any so I did a 4st i-cord for the targets to hang on and bougth some hooks for the i-cord to clip onto the goal. It works pretty well! But I may add bells to the targets at some point so you can hear it hitting and not just see it.
