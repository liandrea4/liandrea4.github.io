## Notes

The chart as provided was a bit annoyingly non-symmetrical so I decided to adjust it a bit - see my [new chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WsnIdpCUvO2Gr-4gnuf6vF674TrOqW-2tqwBImW6Ll8/edit?usp=sharing)! This was my first double knit piece so I had to learn it from scratch and a lot of the tutorials online just say to hold the 2 strands of yarn together when casting on but I found that it didn't reliably alternate the 2 colors. So I instead followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZg4DckTMxc) which essentially just says to explicitly, manually alternate the colors and it worked! 

Working with cheap 100% cotton yarn is the absolute worst so I started this briefly but then put it down for a LONG time before getting the motivation back to pick it up again. Double knitting is also pretty slow-going because you're essentially making 2x as much surface area but the final product is pretty cool I guess! My bind off was a bit wonky (I just did a regular stretchy bind off because I didn't want it to be too tight) but now it is too loose and looks pretty bad :( Oh well, at least it works as a hot pad!
