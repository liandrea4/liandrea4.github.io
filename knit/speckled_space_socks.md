## Notes

My first toe up sock so I needed to start with my (very cheap, low quality) 29" circular needle before switching to my fancy Chiaogoo 9" circular. I followed Judy's Magic Cast On per [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pmxRDZ-cwo) instead of the tutorial that was linked in the pattern.
